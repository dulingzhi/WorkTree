; Derived from nvim-treesitter's queries for
; tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-vue (`queries/vue/injections.scm` plus the
; `; inherits: html_tags` base it pulls in, which is nvim-treesitter's
; html/injections.scm).
;
; The html base comes first so the Vue `lang="..."` rules below take precedence.
;
; Local changes vs upstream:
;   - Neovim-only predicates rewritten for core tree-sitter: `#not-lua-match?`
;     -> `#not-match?`, `#lua-match?` -> `#match?`, and the `<script type>`
;     `#gsub!` rule replaced with an explicit `#any-of?` MIME list.
;   - the two lit-html `${...}` rules were dropped; they need `#offset!`.
;   - the `comment` and `pug` injections were dropped: WorkTree has no such
;     languages, so they were dead patterns. Comments are already coloured by
;     the `(comment) @comment` rule in vue_highlights.scm.
;   - the `<script type="importmap">` -> json rule was dropped. Json's grammar
;     is gated behind `syntax-data` but tree-sitter-vue behind `syntax-web`, so
;     under `--features syntax-web` alone the rule would resolve to no grammar
;     and inject nothing. `cfg(test)` force-enables every grammar, so no test
;     can catch that; not naming a cross-feature language is the only reliable
;     guard. Every other language named here lives in `syntax-web` alongside
;     Vue.
;   - the inline `<a style="…">` -> css rule was dropped. The CSS grammar parses
;     an attribute body as a stylesheet, so `style="color: red"` came out as a
;     type selector (`color` -> Tag, `red` -> Type) rather than a declaration.
;     It also injects unconditionally, so a template full of static inline
;     styles would evict TS_INJECTION_CACHE on its own. Falling back to the html
;     `(attribute_value) @string` rule is both cheaper and less wrong.
;     queries/html_injections.scm still carries this rule and still has the bug.
;
; Note that injection language names resolve through
; diff_syntax_language_for_identifier, so "scss"/"sass"/"less" land on Css,
; "ts"/"tsx" on TypeScript/Tsx, and "regex" on Regex.
;
; This base is NOT queries/html_injections.scm, and cannot be: every rule here
; needs the `lang`/`type` guards that let the vue rules below take over, which
; the html file has no reason to carry. The upshot is that .vue and .html
; templates do not highlight identically -- `<input pattern>` -> regex fires
; only here, inline `style=` only there. That is deliberate, not drift; if
; html_injections.scm grows a rule, decide explicitly whether it belongs here.

; One rule per element rather than upstream's `#any-of?` list per target

; by injection_language_from_name -> diff_syntax_language_for_code_fence_info,
; the same alias table that backs fenced code blocks, so `ts`/`typescript`/
; `mts`, `js`/`mjs`, `tsx`, `jsx`, `css`/`scss`/`less`/`sass`/`postcss` all land
; on a grammar without being enumerated here.
;
; Enumerating them is not just verbose, it is a trap: a value that matched no
; vue rule would *also* be vetoed out of the html base rules above by their
; `#not-match? "\\slang\\s*="` guard, so the entire block would render with no
; highlighting at all rather than falling back. A value the alias table does not
; know (lang="stylus") still injects nothing, which is how the rest of WorkTree
; treats an unrecognised language name.

; thrashes the cache and exhausts the budget on every keystroke.
;
; The skipped cases are exactly the ones an injection adds nothing to:
; `{{ msg }}` and :class="wrapperClass" are already coloured by the @none and
