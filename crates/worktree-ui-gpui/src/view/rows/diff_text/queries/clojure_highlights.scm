; Built on `tree_sitter_clojure_orchard::HIGHLIGHTS_QUERY` (CC0-1.0), which is
; seven patterns wide: literals, comments and the quasiquotation operators. On its
; own it leaves every symbol -- including `defn`, `let` and the head of every form
; -- rendered as plain text, which is most of what a Clojure file is.
;
; The `; --- upstream ---` section is that constant verbatim; everything under
; `; --- worktree ---` is written here.
; `clojure_highlights_query_embeds_the_upstream_base_verbatim` keeps the copy
; honest against a grammar bump.
;
; Symbols are matched by name via `#any-of?` rather than by position. Clojure has
; no grammar-level notion of a special form -- `(defn f [x] x)` and `(f x)` are
; both `list_lit` with a `sym_lit` head -- so the alternative is colouring every
; list head as a function, which paints local calls and macro names alike.
;
; The quoting literals (`quoting_lit`, `syn_quoting_lit`, ...) are deliberately not
; captured as nodes: each spans the whole quoted form, so `'(alpha beta)` would be
; painted end to end. Upstream's operator rule below captures the marker instead.
