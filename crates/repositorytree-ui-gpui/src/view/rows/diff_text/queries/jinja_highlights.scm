; Derived from tree-sitter-jinja-dialects' queries/highlights.scm
; (https://github.com/bennypowers/tree-sitter-jinja-dialects, MIT) at v0.1.1.
;
; The grammar parses the union of Jinja2, Nunjucks, Twig, Tera, Inja and Django
; template syntax, so one query serves every extension in the `Jinja` arm of
; diff_syntax_language_for_identifier.
;
; Local changes vs upstream:
;   - the single `@keyword` list is split. Control flow becomes
;     `@keyword.control`, which RepositoryTree renders semibold (see
;     syntax_highlight_style in ../build.rs); declarations and modifiers stay
;     `@keyword`. Upstream has no reason to care -- the distinction only exists
;     because this theme draws the two differently.
;   - `@function.builtin` is kept rather than narrowed to `@function`: the
;     capture-name table trims dotted suffixes progressively, so it already
;     lands on Function, and keeping the upstream name means a future
;     `function.builtin` colour needs no change here.
;
; Note the delimiters are captured on the anonymous tokens (`{{`, `{%-`, `#}`)
; rather than on the enclosing `output`/`statement`/`comment` node. Capturing
; the container would paint the whole tag, and `@none` cannot be used to punch
; the interior back out -- it emits no token at all, so the outer capture simply
; wins. vue_highlights.scm captures `{{`/`}}` for the same reason.
